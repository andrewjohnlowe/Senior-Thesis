We introduce the GAIA framework -- Generalized Algorithms for Identification Architectures -- a Deep Learning Framework designed for high speed identification and classification of Physics objects within the ATLAS collaboration at CERN. We show large performance improvements over current algorithms within the collaboration. In addition, we introduce two novel contributions -- one physics specific, and one representing an addition to Stacked Denoising Autoencoders, as introduced in \citet{Vincent2008}. In the High Energy Physics context, we introduce the notion of \textit{Online Jet Reweighting}, a scheme used to overcome $p_T$ and $\eta$ dependence in classifiers. We also introduce and provide a formulation of \textit{Inverted Deep Network Encoding (IDNE)}, which builds on top of the greedy approach of serial autoencoding presented in \citep{Vincent2008} to account for global feature structure in high dimensional datasets.
