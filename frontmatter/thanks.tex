\newthought{I would like to thank my advisor}, Professor Tobias F. Golling, for his help, encouragement, and mentorship. His words of encouragement and foresight with respect to where this research could go were, and continue to be, of the utmost value. 

I would also like to thank Dan H. Guest, whose CERN-savvy allowed this work to take off within the ATLAS collaboration.

Thank you Stack Overflow, and thank you Blue State Coffee.
